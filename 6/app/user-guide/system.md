# System

These interfaces are global and can be seen on all pages of the platform.

## Navigation
The left sidebar is an easy way to access any tables you have permission to view as well as any bookmarks you have created. On smaller screens this sidebar may appear hidden and is then accessible by clicking on the "hamburger" icon in the header.

## User Menu
In the bottom-left corner of the platform is your avatar and name – hovering over this will open the user menu. The following are accessible from this menu:

* **Admin Settings** – Only available to the Administrator Group
* **Help & Docs** – An external link to these Directus Docs
* **Discover** – Toggles a system-wide overlay where you can click on things to learn about them
* **File Library** – Navigates to a library of all Directus files
* **User Directory** – Navigates to a directory of all Directus users
* **Messages** – Navigates to your inbox of Directus messages and comments
* **Your Profile** – Navigates to your profile edit page where you can update account info such as your password
* **Logout** – Logs you out of the Directus platform

## Breadcrumb
In the platform's header there is a set of links that show which page you are on, and any parent pages. Clicking on any of these breadcrumbs will take you to that page. On smaller screens this collapses down to only show the current page.

## Bookmarking
Bookmarks are an easy way for users to save specific pages/views for quick access. Clicking the bookmark icon directly to the right of the breadcrumb prompts the user for a custom name, and saves the current page into the navigation. Bookmarks can be deleted by hovering over them and clicking the "X" icon that appears.

*The following parameters are saved when bookmarking:*

* Page
