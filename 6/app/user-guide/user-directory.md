# User Directory

This page provides a listing of all Directus users on the platform. Clicking on a user's avatar or name anywhere within the platform will open a modal window with their public info (eg: name, email, and location). Other information is private and can only be seen by that user and Administrators (eg: token, encrypted password). No one has the ability to see your *actual* password, not even Administrators.

> **Inviting New Users:** Only Administrators can add/invite new users.

> **Developer Note:** You can add additional columns to `directus_files` to extend and customize this system.
