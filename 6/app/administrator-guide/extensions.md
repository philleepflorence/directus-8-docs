# Extensions
By design, Directus keeps things simple. Only key features utilized by the majority of users make it into the core framework. Anything not handled by the Core platform can be added via extensions. Extensions take advantage of the system’s authentication, ACL, and data connections – they are a blank canvas of extensibility with no restrictions. 

*Examples of Extensions:*

* Custom Interfaces
* Advanced Data Visualizations
* Dashboards
* Site Analytics
* Integrated Point-of-Sale System
