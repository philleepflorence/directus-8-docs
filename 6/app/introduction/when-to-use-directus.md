# When to Use Directus

## Websites
Directus is an excellent alternative to traditional CMS. Small sites have less bloat to deal with and worry about. Large sites get total control over database architecture for optimizing performance. Complex sites are more attainable since you're no longer limited to the technologies, libraries, and languages of an all-in-one solution. And because everything's decoupled you'll be prepared for the future should you need to support additional clients such as a native app.

## Native Apps
Directus is a CMS that wasn't built exclusively for websites – so there's no more struggling to find a good way to manage content or even raw data from your Native App(s). But that doesn't mean you're stuck with a highly technical datastore interface, you and your clients can interact with data through intuitive and safe interfaces.

## Multi-Client Projects
Perhaps you know in advance that your project will require a website, native app, *and* kiosk – Directus has you covered. With agnostic data you can connect any and all facets of your project to a single, centralized source of content. Use our API or SDKs to connect each client in the appropriate language.

## Experimental Projects
Maybe you don't even know what you're building! From experiential installations to IoT devices, sometimes you just need a quick way to visualize or manage data. Sequel-Pro, PHP-My-Admin, and the command line aren't always the easiest (or safest) way manage files, validation, and relational data – why make things harder than they need to be?

## Stand-Alone Tool
Finally, not all data needs to be connected. Does your company need Project Management, CRM, or other tools? Why pay for a service that you may outgrow or be limited by? Why work with disparate platforms for each service when you can combine them into one system? With Directus you can easily design your own tool with its own workflows and interfaces – no limitations.
