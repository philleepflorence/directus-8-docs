# Authentication

> Directus is serious about security, and takes every precaution to ensure your data is kept secure. Below are a few of the features we employ to safeguard your projects.

## Password Encryption

The API encrypts every Directus user's password as a hash using a strong one-way hashing algorithm called `bcrypt`. The `CRYPT_BLOWFISH` algorithm creates a 60 character long hash with a recognizable `$2y$` identifier. All hashes are generated with a random salt and a cost of `10`. This cost determines the rounds of expansion used, so our default cost of `10` is equal to 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) iterations â€” a good balance for most hardware.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA is individually enabled from each User's Profile. To do so, click on the "Enable 2FA" button, and scan the QR code in your authenticator app.

::: danger
This QR code will only be shown to you once. After you save your profile, the next time you log in, you will be required to enter your One-Time Password (OTP) after your email and password.
:::

::: tip
Administrators can force 2FA at the User Role level.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

For Single Sign-On (SSO) to function properly, a user with a matching email address must already exist within `directus_users`. If you would like to manage users _externally_ then you would use our [SCIM endpoints](../api/reference.md#scim). The following SSO options are supported:

* Google
* Okta
* Twitter
* Facebook
* GitHub

### Google SSO Setup

Follow [Google instructions](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OpenIDConnect#registeringyourapp) on how to register an app and get the `client_id` and `client_secret` tokens.

If you want to use Google+ API, Read these steps on [how to enable/disable Google+ APIs](https://support.google.com/a/answer/3187191)

:::tip NOTE
We support google SSO with both Google+ (soon to be discontinued) and OpenID Connect.

### Okta SSO Setup

#### Setup

1. **Sign Up**: First create a Developer Okta account at https://developer.okta.com/signup/
2. **Get Email**: Once you've created an account, a temporary password will be emailed to you.
3. **Log In**: Activate your account by logging in with this temporary password and setting a new password.
4. **Create App**: Create a new Okta web application by choosing _Applications_ in the main menu and then clicking on "Add Application". `https://<your-okta-id>-admin.oktapreview.com/admin/apps/active`
5. **Choose Web**: Pick _Web_, click Next.
6. **Login Redirect**: Make sure that _Login Redirect URIs_ is set to `[your-directus-host]/[project-name]/auth/sso/okta/callback`. For example `http://localhost/_/auth/sso/okta/callback`.
7. **Get Keys**: Click on the newly created application and go to _General > Client Credentials_ and you will see the `Client ID` and the `Client Secret`. Use these values for the Okta `client_id` and `client_secret` in your API project configuration, eg: `config/<project-name>.php`.
8. **Base URL**: The `base_url` can be found under _API_ in the main menu. You will see a list of Authorization Servers to pick from. The URL is under the column labeled `Issuer URI`.

::: tip SCIM
Okta is also capable of externally managing your Directus users, allowing for more unified user provisioning within your organization. This is accomplished by using our [API's dedicated SCIM endpoints](../api/reference.md#scim).
