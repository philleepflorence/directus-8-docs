# SDK JS

> A lightweight JavaScript library that makes working with the Directus API even easier. It keeps you logged in, handles token management, and provides quick access to all [API Endpoints](../api/reference.md).

## Installation

You can install the SDK from `npm` by running:

```bash
npm install @directus/sdk-js
```

```js
import DirectusSDK from "@directus/sdk-js";

const client = new DirectusSDK();
```

Alternatively, you can use the bundle hosted on a static npm cdn:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@directus/sdk-js@5.3.4/dist/directus-sdk.umd.min.js"></script>

<script>
  const client = new DirectusSDK();
</script>
```

## Usage

### Authentication

You can connect and login to the API in a few ways:

**Within a Directus Extension**

If you're making API requests from a custom VueJS Directus extension, you can use the credentials the user already provided Directus on initial login.

```js
import DirectusSDK from "@directus/sdk-js";

const client = new DirectusSDK({
  url: "https://api.directus.cloud/",
  project: "dcABCDEF123456",
  storage: window.localStorage
});
```

However, Directus provides each extension VueJS component with `this.$api`, an instance of `DirectusSDK` already logged in. Read more at https://docs.directus.io/advanced/app/sdk-api.html.

```js
export default {
  name: "example-component",
  created() {
    // No login needed
    this.$api.getItems("projects")
      .then(/* do something with response */)
  }
}
```

**Using JWT**

If you're making API requests from your own client side JS, you should login using the asynchronous `login` method. The SDK will fetch an access token based on the credentials and use that for all subsequent requests.

```js{3,5-10}
import DirectusSDK from "@directus/sdk-js";

const client = new DirectusSDK();

// This returns a promise - don't try to access any data until this promise resolves
client.login({
  url: "https://api.directus.cloud/",
  project: "dcABCdefHIJklm",
  email: "admin@example.com",
  password: "password"
});
```

#### Staying logged in

The SDK will automatically refresh the token until you call the `.logout()` method.

You can provide a storage method to persist the token across refreshes and browser re-opens:

```js{6}
import DirectusSDK from "@directus/sdk-js";

const client = new DirectusSDK({
  url: "https://api.directus.cloud/",
  project: "dcABCdefHIJklm",
  storage: window.localStorage
});
```

This storage can be any provider, as long as it has synchronous `.getItem()`, `.setItem()` and `.removeItem()` methods. `window.localStorage` and `window.sessionStorage` work natively in the browser.

**Using a static access token**
Alternatively, you can connect to the API with a static token (as controlled by the `token` field in the directus_users collection). This token doesn't expire and thus shouldn't be used on the client side.

```js{3-7}
import DirectusSDK from "@directus/sdk-js";

const client = new DirectusSDK({
  url: "https://api.directus.cloud/",
  project: "dcABCdefHIJklm",
  token: "demo"
});
```

:::tip
If you're using solely routes and data with public access, you don't have to log in.
:::

### Requests

All methods return a promise that either resolves with the requested data, or rejects with the reason why.

```js
client.getItems("movies")
  .then(data => {
    // Do something with the data
  })
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

This also means that you can use the SDK with `async/await`:

```js
async function fetchAllItems() {
  const data = await client.getItems("movies");
  return data;
}
```

## Reference

Note that all of the following methods are asynchronous and return promises.

If you think a method is missing, please reach out on GitHub or [Slack](https://directus.chat)!

### Authentication

#### `login(credentials)`

Login to the API

The credentials object has the following structure:

```js
{
  email: "admin@example.com",
  password: "password",

  // Optional:
  url: "https://api.directus.cloud/",
  project: "dcABCdefHIJklm", // Defaults to '_'
  persist: true // Defaults to true
}
```

:::warning
Make sure to provide the `url` of the API you're trying to log in to before running the `login()` method if you don't provide the url in the `credentials` object.
:::

Login to the demo API without keeping the user logged in

```js
client.login({
  email: "admin@example.com",
  password: "password",
  persist: false
});
```

Login to a previously defined API URL

```js
client.url = "https://api.directus.cloud/"

client.login({
  email: "admin@example.com",
  password: "password"
});
```

The login method accepts the `mode` flag that lets you toggle between JWT and Cookies for authentication. 

```js
client.login({
  url: "https://demo.directus.io",
  email: "admin@example.com",
  password: "password",
  mode: "cookie"
});
```

:::tip
You don't have to provide a persist storage adapter when using cookies. The API will manage the cookie and its expiration.
:::

---

#### `logout()`

Make the SDK forget the token, project, and URL of the API.

```js
client.logout();
```

---

#### `refresh(token)`

Will fetch a new access token based on the provided token.

Refresh a token stored in sessionStorage with a new token.

```js
const savedToken = window.sessionStorage.getItem("token");

client.refresh(savedToken)
  .then(({ token }) => {
    window.sessionStorage.setItem("token", token);
  });
```

:::tip
If you use the `login()` method, you most likely don't need to touch this one as it's being managed for you.
:::

---

#### `refreshIfNeeded()`

Checks if the currently used token is about to expire (< 30s until expiry) and will fetch a new one if that's the case.


```js
client.refreshIfNeeded();
```

:::tip
If you use the `login()` method, you most likely don't need to touch this one as it's being managed for you.

### Internal methods

These methods are used by all other methods listed above and aren't generally used in normal operation. You can use the following methods to make requests to custom endpoints or use HTTP methods that aren't provided by the methods above. The methods down below are scoped in the `api` class.

#### `request(method, endpoint, params = {}, data = {}, noProject = false, headers = {})`

Make a generic request to the API based on the parameters provided.

Make a post request to `/update`:

```js
client.api.request("post", "/update");
```

Get the server info:

```js
client.api.request("get", "/server/info", {}, {}, true);
```

---

#### `get(endpoint, params = {})`

Send a `GET` request to a given endpoint.

Get all movies sorted by date:

```js
client.api.get("/items/movies", {
  sort: "-datetime"
});
```

---

#### `post(endpoint, body = {}, params = {})`

Send a `POST` request to a given endpoint.

Create a new movie only returning the ID of the newly created item

```js
client.api.post(
  "/items/movies",
  { title: "A New Hope" },
  { fields: "id" }
);
```

---

#### `patch(endpoint, body = {}, params = {})`

Send a `PATCH` request to a given endpoint.

Update the movie with ID 5

```js
client.api.patch("/items/movies/5", { title: "A Newer Hope" });
```

---

#### `put(endpoint, body = {}, params = {})`

Send a `PUT` request to a given endpoint.

_This method isn't used by the API by default_

---

#### `delete(endpoint)`

Send a `DELETE` request to a given endpoint.

Delete the movie with ID 5

```js
client.api.delete("/items/movies/5");
```

---

#### `startInterval(fireImmediately = false)`

Start the token refresh interval. This will check the tokens validity every 10 seconds and will fetch a new token when the current token is about to expire.

The `fireImmediately` method controls whether or not to immediately try refreshing the token.

```js
client.startInterval(true);
```

---

#### `stopInterval()`

Stops the refresh token interval

```js
client.stopInterval();
```
